              Losing weight isn't easy - we know. But with a membership to
              MyFitnessPal.com, you'll get the tools you need to successfully
              take weight off - and keep it off. And best of all, you can signup
              for free, no strings attached. So put away your credit card -
              you'll never have to pay a cent. <br /> <br /> Study after study
              has confirmed the benefits of keeping track of the food you eat
              and the activity you do. It's simple - the more consistently you
              track your food intake, the more likely you are to lose weight.
              That's why every successful weight management program suggests
              that you keep a food diary and/or an activity log. But recording
              everything you eat without the right tools can be tedious at best,
              or simply impossible at worst. <br /> <br /> At MyFitnessPal.com,
              we focus on making sure you can log your meals as quickly and
              easily as possible. Because the easier we make it for you, the
              more likely you are to stay on track, and the more likely you are
              to succeed in your weight loss goals.

              The reason our system is so easy to use is because it learns from
              you! All of us tend to eat the same foods over time.
              MyFitnessPal.com remembers what you've eaten and done most often
              in the past, and makes it easy for you to add those foods again to
              your log. So the more you track your meals, the easier it becomes!
